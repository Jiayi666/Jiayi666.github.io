## Set Up Tomcat Web Server

- In unix system, to bind webserver with port number less than 1024, we need to `sudo` the operation.
- Use `[sudo] lsof -i :port_number` to check the usage of certain port.
- To set the `Context` tag in tomcat, we have to use **absolute path** for parameter `docBase`.

#### Difference Between Static & Dynamic Web Page

- Static Web Page: The returned html is static / pre-built.
- Dynamic Web Page: The returned html is dynamically *get* based on the request information from database or other program.

## Servlet For Requests Processing

### Running Process

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The servlet running process described in the following image

![running_process](\img\in-post\2019-07-24-servlet\running_process.png)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The user firstly accessed the `.html` file for all the front end services, then the *login button* is bind with a `POST` action to `/login` in the html file. This action will cause the server to load / instanciate the LoginServlet and pass the requst and response object to the servlet.

### Jump

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As shown in the image below, there are two kind of jumps in Java servlet: *server end jump* and *client end jump*.

![jump](\img\in-post\2019-07-24-servlet\jump.png)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, all the jumps are **initiated** by the server based on the request information. But the difference is the server end jump will do the **redirect** on server side, and the client end jump will **tell** the client to go another place.
