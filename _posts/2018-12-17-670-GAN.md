### Vanila GAN Implementation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[This](https://medium.com/ai-society/gans-from-scratch-1-a-deep-introduction-with-code-in-pytorch-and-tensorflow-cb03cdcdba0f) is a very decent instruction to implement a vanila GAN for MNIST from scratch.

### DCGAN vs Vanilia GAN
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Here](https://github.com/znxlwm/pytorch-MNIST-CelebA-GAN-DCGAN) is an implementation for DCGAN in MNIST and CelebA. This person also has implementation for CDCGAN in MNIST and CelebA.

### How to train a GAN
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Here](https://github.com/soumith/ganhacks) is a paper about **how to train a GAN**.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before reading the paper, I will recommend firstly look at [this](https://medium.com/@jonathan_hui/gan-what-is-wrong-with-the-gan-cost-function-6f594162ce01). This post introduced the reason for GAN being very hard to train.

### How to evaluate a GAN
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation a GAN is what I didn't do well in the project. [Here](https://medium.com/@jonathan_hui/gan-how-to-measure-gan-performance-64b988c47732) is some useful way to evaluate the result of GAN. The main idea to to generate images with the same distribution with training data.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And [here](https://github.com/mseitzer/pytorch-fid) is an available implementation of FID.

### Star GAN
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;StarGAN is a comparatively new method. Instead of 'giving a label, generate image', StarGAN is a image-to-image translation.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It official implimentation can be found [here](https://github.com/yunjey/stargan) and [here](https://github.com/adam9500370/Facial-Expression-Generation) is an interesting extension for StarGAN for expression generation.
