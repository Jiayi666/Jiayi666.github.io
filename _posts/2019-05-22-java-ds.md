> [This great tutorial](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-tutorial) showed a lot about Java designing principle as well as the interface for Java data structures.

> [This tutorial](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java) is wonderful for basic Java data structure and syntax.

> [Geek for Geek](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/) has great explaination for low level Java package implementation such as the Java collections framework. It shows show Java collectors are defined and implimented.

### Difference Between Type & Class

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Java, there are identifiers for **primitive types** such as `int` and `char`. But as shown in [this answer](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-an-integer-and-int-in-Java), `int` and `char` **variable** **isn't a object**! They are unmutable and have no methods and fields. Also, primitive typed variables are offten stored in **stack** which makes it hard to manage in Java collections.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, we can't use `int` and `char` to instanciate a generic typed class. Instead, we need to use a **real class**, which is `Interger` and `Character`.

### Java Array

> Check [this tutorial](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java/arrays.html) for more details about Java arrays.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Java array itself though **is an object** which stores in **heap**. To instantiate a Java array, the most complete way should be:

~~~
int[] intArray, intArray2;

intArray = new int[10];

intArray2 = new int[]{1,2,3,4,5};
~~~

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Java array class, the only thing we need to use is `arr.length` and `arr[i]`. Put special attention that `.length()` is a method in most all other data structures but it's a field in Java array.

### String

> String represents **fixed-length, immutable** character sequences 

> `"abc"` is a Java `String` object, or we can also call the string type constructor by `String()` etc. to initialize a string object.

> In Java, the **single quotes** for `char`, and **double quotes** for `String`.

- `str0 + str1` is equal to `str0.concat(str1)` which will return the concatenation of two string.
- `str.length()` for length of the string.
- `str.substring(a,b)` for substring from a to b.
- `str.charAt(x)` for charactor at x (return type should be `Char`).
- `str0.equals(str1)` to check if equal.
- `str0.compareTo(str1)` to calculate the `<=>` between strings.
- `str.toLowerCase()` & `str.toUpperCase()`.
- `str.split(Char)` to split by char.

#### Iterate a Java String

> Note that `String` itself **isn't iterable**, it's not a subclass of the class iterator, which is in the top of Java collection framework.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[This post](https://www.techiedelight.com/iterate-over-characters-string-java/) gives great methods for iterate with a String. The most important is using `String.charAt(i)`, `String.toCharArray()`, `String.split("")` and using `CharacterIterator`.

### Array

> The general form of a one-dimensional array **declaration** is `type var-name[];` OR `type[] var-name;` So, in the main function, we can do both `String[] args` and `String args[]`.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Java, variable **declearation** and **instantiation** can be separated. For example:

~~~
int[] arr;
arr = new int[10];
~~~

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning, we just decleared a reference variable in stack then we **point it** to a real object in heap. Of course, we can also do `int[] arr = new int[10];` to initialize while declearing. Check [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/arrays-in-java/) for more information.

### Java Collections Framework

> A Collection represents a group of objects known as its elements. A Java collection is very similar as a C++ container.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As shown in [this tutorial](https://www.javatpoint.com/collections-in-java), the design of Java collection framework is **a bunch of classes**. Different Java collections are related (extends) togather and inheritate methods & variable from basic classes as iterator or collection interface. Such design makes all the collections share similar interface.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the design of Java collection framework, I should also learn about how to design Java projects ---- **interfeaces are created hierarchically by class extends / implements** just as the image shown below.
