### String

> `"abc"` is a Java `String` object, or we can also call the string type constructor by `String()` etc. to initialize a string object.

- `str0 + str1` is equal to `str0.concat(str1)` which will return the concatenation of two string.
- `str.length()` for length of the string.
- `str.substring(a,b)` for substring from a to b.
- `str.charAt(x)` for charactor at x (return type should be `Char`).
- `str0.equals(str1)` to check if equal.
- `str0.compareTo(str1)` to calculate the `<=>` between strings.
- `str.toLowerCase()` & `str.toUpperCase()`.
- `str.split(Char)` to split by char.

### Array

> The general form of a one-dimensional array **declaration** is `type var-name[];` OR `type[] var-name;` So, in the main function, we can do both `String[] args` and `String args[]`.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Java, variable **declearation** and **instantiation** can be separated. For example:

~~~
int[] arr;
arr = new int[10];
~~~

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning, we just decleared a reference variable in stack then we **point it** to a real object in heap. Of course, we can also do `int[] arr = new int[10];` to initialize while declearing. Check [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/arrays-in-java/) for more information.

### Java Collections Framework

> A Collection represents a group of objects known as its elements. A Java collection is very similar as a C++ container.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As shown in [this tutorial](https://www.javatpoint.com/collections-in-java), the design of Java collection framework is **a bunch of classes**. Different Java collections are related (extends) togather and inheritate methods & variable from basic classes as iterator or collection interface. Such design makes all the collections share similar interface.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the design of Java collection framework, I should also learn about how to design Java projects ---- **interfeaces are created hierarchically by class extends / implements** just as the image shown below.
