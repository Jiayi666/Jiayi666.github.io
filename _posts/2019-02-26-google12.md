> When analyze tree, especially when looking for iteration critieria, **use None** leaves! Check [this question](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/submissions/) and [this solution](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inorder-tree-traversal-without-recursion/).

## To Do

> It really works better to read fundamental for a data structure and try some leetcode problems related with it soon.

* Bit manipulation problems
* Graph and union-find

## Python Programming

* There is no `xor` in python, we can just us `a != b` to represent that `a xor b`. But we need to take care that `!=` has pretty high priority, we must use `(a is None) != (b is None)` in this case.

## Tree

> It's better to read about the slide for schools like [this](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~adamchik/15-121/lectures/Trees/trees.html), which is much more systematic.

### Terms

* PreOrder, InOrder, PostOrder, LevelOrder
* Full tree, Complete Tree

### Travesal

> The key for traversal a tree is to **use while + Null critieria** to go to the leaves.

> It is crutial to see the difference between tree traversal methods from the **subtree** perspective as described in DFS below.

> Take care at the order (pre-, in-, post-, level-) you are using while traversal a tree.

> In traversal, the brute-force way is to use **recurssion**, by seeing the traversal problem as visiting the left-subtree or right-subtree first, we can easily write a recurssion code for it.

#### DFS

> DFS is **inorder traversal!** Not start from root.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning of inorder traversal is **in every subtree, we always print left->root->right**, here left and right is the left subtree and right subtree. An detail implementation can be found [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inorder-tree-traversal-without-recursion/).

#### Morri's Travesal

> Inorder Tree Traversal without recursion and without stack!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The traversal order for Morri's algorithm is the **same as DFS**, which is also a **inorder traversal**. A detailed explaination can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5502916/explain-morris-inorder-tree-traversal-without-using-stacks-or-recursion) while a example code is [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inorder-tree-traversal-without-recursion-and-without-stack/).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morri's traversal modifies the tree when traversal, so it reduced the space complexity for DFS. But in the step of `pre->right = NULL`, we break the link we made and recovered the original tree.

### Construction

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To construct a tree, we firstly need to know *how is the input data arranged*. Is it in preorder or postorder? And what kind of tree we need to construct, it's impossible to build an arbitrary tree.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may need to build a full tree or a complete tree. Following the property of corresponding order (in-, pre-, post-) is the most important.


## LeetCode Problems

#### 55. Jump Game

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[This solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/solution/) is a perfect demonstration of **using DP from optimization recurssion** and discover bette algorithms.
