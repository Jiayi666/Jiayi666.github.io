> Two major steps for solution all programming problems: 
> 
> 1. How do we define each **state?** Programs are just a series of **chained (by actions)** states.
> 
> 2. Do you know how to solve the problem (**take next action**) given a random state?
> 
> 3. What is the **information** needed to determine our **action** in each state?
> 
> Also, take care that many problems may have **sub-problems!** In this case, we need to define new states for sub / super problem.

#### 207. Course Schedule

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the situation of a graph, it is easy to define the **state** by **check each connected subgraph**!
