> Two major steps for solution all programming problems: 
> 
> 1. How do we define each **state?** Programs are just a series of **chained (by actions)** states.
> 
> 2. Do you know how to solve the problem (**take next action**) given a random state?
> 
> 3. What is the **information** needed to determine our **action** in each state?
> 
> Also, take care that many problems may have **sub-problems!** In this case, we need to define new states for sub / super problem.

#### 207. Course Schedule

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the situation of a graph, it is easy to define the **state** by **check each connected subgraph**!

#### 410. Split Array Largest Sum

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Backtracking basically happens when we have to *list* all the results. However, if we need to find the **optimal** result, I believe we may avoid backtracking by some way. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2D even ND dynamic programming may be detected also by observing **redundent calculations**, the key is that current optimal may be affected by more than just one previous optimal states. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, keep in mind that **state may not be 1D**.
