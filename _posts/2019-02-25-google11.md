> Think about DP when you use recurssion! Think about state!

### To Do


### Dynamic Programming

> In my previous post [here](https://jiayi666.github.io/2019/02/17/leetcode-google3/), I have wrote about DP and I also considered its relation with recurssion. Here I want to focus on tabulation and memoimization.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to [this problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break/discuss/43995/A-Simple-Python-DP-solution), the reason I fail to solve it is that I didn't try to observe the **state** for my recurssion.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tabulation and memoimization is just two ways of implementing DP, both of them still need you to figure out the state transition relationship first. In [this example](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tabulation-vs-memoizatation/), memoimization means **only use recurssion when previous state haven't been calculated**.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To solve a DP problem like [this problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break/discuss/43995/A-Simple-Python-DP-solution), we first:

1. Define the state, here just `s`
2. List default states (**what is the value for each state**)
3. Analyze how the latter state's value is based on previous states

### Python Programming

* Mutable object is **not hashable** in python.
* Iteration with dictionary `dict.keys()`, `dict.values()`, `dict.items()`.


### LeetCode Problems

#### 16. 3Sum Closest

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in [this problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum-closest/discuss/7871/Python-O(N2)-solution), see my implementation, my code is **not straightforward**. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the complexity of algorithm won't change, I care too much for some trivial problems such as use `prev*gap` to find the minimum gap but just compare the new difference with previously best difference is both **straightforward and robust**.

#### 29. Divide Two Integers

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Study the code styles is so important. It is very important to write code with simplicity and  straight-forward.

#### 46. Permutations

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This [solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations/discuss/18296/Simple-Python-solution-(DFS).) proposed a new vision that **backtracking is the path of DFS**!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compare with [this problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/letter-combinations-of-a-phone-number/solution/), the implementation is actually the same as using *the path of DFS*.
