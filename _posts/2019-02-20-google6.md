### To Do

* Summary programming paradigms!
* Binary Search (Search Algorithms)
* Python build-in functions, [link](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html)
* Python passing by reference visualization!!! [Link](http://www.pythontutor.com/).

### Python Programming

* `str.count(char)` will return the number of appearance for `char` in `str`.
* The string type is unmutable thus is not *pass by reference*! You can treat it like numbers.

### LeetCode Problems

#### 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/), actually I did pretty good in this problem but I can still do better in tree travesal.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Check the commented code and final code in the link, it is easy to see that **only check `node is None`** is much more consise than check `node.left` and `node.right`.

#### 268. Missing Number

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/), don't just think about algortithms, **analyze the problem first!**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the special point for the problem? What kinds of attributes it has? How can we possibly use them?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way to think about problem is actually very similar to the *questioning* process in [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKu_SEDAykw&t=1s).

#### 203. Remove Linked List Elements

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-linked-list-elements/submissions/), remember one skill for dealing/travesal over linked-list: **use dummy pointer to include head to checking loop!** Just like I did in this question, a dummy pointer will make your code much consise and your thinking more fluent.

#### 189. Rotate Array

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to get used to all possible operations and it's complexity for normally used data structure. In this problem `list.reverse()` is crutial.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take care that **python `list.reverse()` can't reverse just a slice of the list!** Check [this link](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/discuss/54426/Summary-of-solutions-in-Python), we need to implement the reverse function by ourselves.

#### 69. Sqrt(x)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a perfect problem that reminds me **firstly analyze what is the fundation of this problem!** Is it about search? traversal?
