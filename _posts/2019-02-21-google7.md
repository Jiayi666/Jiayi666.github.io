> The key for any computer algorithm is **"in what state I should do what"?** So we need to *define our state* first and find the most efficient way *in that state to solve the problem*.

### To Do

* Summary programming paradigms!
* Binary Search (Search Algorithms)
* Python build-in functions, [link](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html)

### Python Programming

* Use `dict.pop(key,default)` to remove item from a dictionary.
* Even for just normal dictionary, `dict[key]=value` will **add new item to the dictinary!**

### LeetCode Problems

#### 11. Container With Most Water

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following is how should we analyze this problem:

1. This is a searching problem that we are going to search for a pair that maximize the containing water.
2. The key for any algorithm is **in what state I should do what**! For searching, we need to **define the state** (*two pointer in this problem*, state is algorithm paradigms) and then think about the most efficient thing to do in the state.
