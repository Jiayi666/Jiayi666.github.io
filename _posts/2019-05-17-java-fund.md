### Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

Higher Level Language Ex. C++, Java

Middle-Level Languages Ex. C

Low-Level Language Ex. Assembly

Finally the lowest level as the Machine Language.

- Compiler: A compiler is a program which converts a program from one level of language to another. Example conversion of C++ program into machine code.
- Interpreter: An interpreter is a program which converts a program at one level to another programming language at the same level. Example conversion of **bytecode into machine code**.

> Java is needs both compiler and interpreter to work. The java compiler converts high-level Java code into bytecode (which is also a type of machine code). The Just In Time Code generator within JVM converts the bytecode into the native machine code which are at the same programming levels.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of using compiler is **different platform use different machine code!** For example the machine code in Mac (A12 processor) is different with Windows (Intel processor) not to mention mobile platforms. So, **the software compile in one platform can't run in another platform!**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JVM is introduced to deal with this. The JAVA compiler won't compile JAVA code into machine language, instead it's compiled to **bytecode** (`.class` files). Then in whatever platform, as long as **JVM is running in the RAM**, the JVM will takecare of platforms and **translate** the bytecode into machine code **as run**. The name Java Virtual Machine just explained it's function!
