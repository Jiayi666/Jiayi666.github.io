&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the [How2J](http://how2j.cn/k/jdbc/jdbc-mysql/386.html) tutorial, there are 4 major steps for connecting and executing SQL statement from Java server:

1. Initiate JDBC **driver** class.
2. Build a **connection object** by providing needed informations.
3. Build a **statement object** and use `statement_object.execute(String s)` to execute SQL statement.
4. Database connection is an important resources, always remember to close statement first, then connection.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the convention of accessing database from Java program, we will build a **DAO**, which means **data access object**. The DAO should implement all the functions about CRUD (creation, retrival, update, deletion -- the 4 major operation for data), and the Java program such as servlet can only use the DAO to access certain tables instead of write the code everytime.
