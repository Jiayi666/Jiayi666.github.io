### LPR ROS and Gazebo

#### How to install ROS package

##### How to uninstall ROS
[Here](https://answers.ros.org/question/57213/how-i-completely-remove-all-ros-from-my-system/) is the instruction. Must remove ROS clearly before you start to compile everything again. The remaining from old version can hard a lot. **Remember to log out**, only after log out some cached ROS setting is removed.

##### From ROS official website
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use `apt-get install` to install ROS package. The installed package will be automatically installed to `/opt/ros/share/`, which is the defaul ROS director.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ROS website, the display of package name and its inside is very wierd. For example, the **joystick_drivers** package is shown as `joystick_drivers:joy|ps3joy|spancenav_node|wiimote`. I have no idea what the latter part is, but if you want to install the package, just run `apt-get install ros-<ros version, such as indigo>-joystick-drivers`.

##### How to install ROS when Gazebo conflict
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gazebo version used in LPR is 6.7 and for indigo the default is gazebo 2.xx, so there will be a gazebo version conflict when you try to trinstall ROS in a lab pc. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The method to override the existing gazebo is [this](https://blog.csdn.net/sinat_34816302/article/details/79145382).

`sudo aptitude install ros-indigo-desktop-full`

##### Protobuf version conflict
1. The problem of protobuf version conflict can be solve [here](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/issues/6527). The main problem is 1. install version of protobuf too old. 2. packages installed by `apt-get` and from source is in different place and conflict with each other.
2. Error like this can directly check the file that leads to the error! There will be a header showing the required version of package. See instructions [here](http://answers.gazebosim.org/question/4733/this-file-was-generated-by-an-older-version-of-protoc-while-following-gazebo-tutorial/).
3. We can also go directly into the `CMakeCache.txt` file and vim search to quickly locate where is the packages used in cmake. This is also the case in `catkin_make`.

##### Compile Hardware first!
In the code base for LPR, there is a `makeLinux` file needs to be executed in Hardware file first! This will compile all the hardware package for ubot.

### CMake

#### Curl with CMake
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The default CMake will make a copy of `libcurl` when it is compiled and `SSL` is disabled by default.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way to compile CMake with SSL is [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44633043/cmake-libcurl-was-built-with-ssl-disabled-https-not-supported). Remember to `make install`.

### Ubuntu

#### Terminal output
1. One very interesting problem is how to dump terminal output to a file, so you can get the unlimited scrolling and fast search for error and other information. The way to do that can be found [here](collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status)
2. Search in vim can based on both direction. Like shown [here](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Searching). Use `?` to search forward while use `/` to search backward.
3. Use `tee` to print command output to stdout and a file a the same time. Instructions can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/418896/how-to-redirect-output-to-a-file-and-stdout)
