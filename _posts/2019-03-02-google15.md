### To Do

1. OOD problems.
2. Graph algorithm implementation.
3. Union-find implementation.

### Python Programming

* Remove key from dictionary `dict.pop(key, default)` or `del dict[key]` but need make sure key is in dict.
* The `if` statement in list comprehension should be **placed at the end**! `a = [x for x in board if x != "."]`.
* In a lot of designing problems, we need to implement functions like `next` where **generator** can be very useful. [This reference](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/generator) gives clear tutorial for how to use and define a generator function in python.

### LeetCode Problems

#### 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this problem, I see that *another way to change recurssion to iteration is to* **separate situations more clearly**. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, for *information needs to be used latter after first visit*, we should think about put it in stack or queue.

#### 380. Insert Delete GetRandom O(1)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an OOD problem and to answer this kind of problem, we normally need to **combine multiple data structure**, if we pursuit operation efficiency, we can use more memory.

#### 341. Flatten Nested List Iterator

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Use stack to avoid recurssion** is a very important idea! Just like the "Basic Calculator" I mentioned in last post, stack can store what we are working on right now for future use!

#### 322. Coin Change

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The **search with tree** is just equal to backtracking! This kind of search is NP algorithm and we can use DP, divide and conquer or other ways to improve it.
