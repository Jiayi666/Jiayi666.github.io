### To Do

1. OOD problems.
2. Graph algorithm implementation.

### Python Programming

* Remove key from dictionary `dict.pop(key, default)` or `del dict[key]` but need make sure key is in dict.

### LeetCode Problems

#### 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this problem, I see that *another way to change recurssion to iteration is to* **separate situations more clearly**. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, for *information needs to be used latter after first visit*, we should think about put it in stack or queue.

#### 380. Insert Delete GetRandom O(1)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an OOD problem and to answer this kind of problem, we normally need to **combine multiple data structure**, if we pursuit operation efficiency, we can use more memory.

#### 341. Flatten Nested List Iterator

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Use stack to avoid recurssion** is a very important idea! Just like the "Basic Calculator" I mentioned in last post, stack can store what we are working on right now for future use!
