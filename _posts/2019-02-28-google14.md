### To Do

1. Implement Graph Algorithm.

### Python Programming

* Python has no **max heap** implementation, the `heapq.heapify(array)` can only create min heap. We can first use `nums = [-n for n in nums]` to create max heap.

### LeetCode Problems

#### 98. Validate Binary Search Tree

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take care that in a binary search tree, the left subtree must be **smaller than** it's root, **it can't be equal!**

#### 215. Kth Largest Element in an Array

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[This solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/discuss/167837/Python-or-tm) gives a great explaination for using min-heap and max-heap. Remember that the complexity for building max-heap is just `O(n)`!

#### 227. Basic Calculator II

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[This problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/basic-calculator-ii/discuss/63076/Python-short-solution-with-stack.) give a nice example of using **stack**. It's useage is just like what we did in micro controller: **to store partially done result**.
