### To Do

* Summary programming paradigms! (Greedy)
* Binary Search (Search Algorithms)
* Python build-in functions, [link](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html)
* Calculating time/space complexity! Especially worst case.
* (Doing below) Summary special/abstractive features for each data structure!

### Graph

> The basic idea for solving graph problem is to find a way to **treat the graph as a tree!**

> Check [this tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/graph-data-structure-and-algorithms/) for most of the basic algorithms and features for graph.

> [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufj5_bppBsA) talked about many basic graph algorithms like union-find, Kruskal's Algorithm etc.

1. Graph Representation
2. Create a Graph
3. Traversal Graph with BFS and DFS
4. Graph Connectivity
5. Union-find
6. Minimum Spanning Tree (Kruskal’s & Prim's Algorithm)
7. Shortest Path (Dijkstra’s & Floyd–Warshall Algorithm)

#### Terms

* DAG: [directed acyclic graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph), a directed graph with no directed cycle.

#### Graph Representation

> The most normal way to represent a graph is **[adjacency list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_list)** and **adjacency matrix**. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adjacency list is just like what we used in our network embedding project. It's just a list of **unordered** edges in the graph. And adjacency matrix is too large and space inefficient.

#### Create a Graph

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to create a graph in memory varies from how the graph is represented.

##### Directed Unweighted Graph

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For graphs represented by adjacency list, in this [exmaple](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/union-find/), just use `add_edge()` to **build a dictionary** where the key is current node and values is the list that reachable in hop=1 from the current node.

##### Directed Weighted Graph

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Check [this tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/prims-mst-for-adjacency-list-representation-greedy-algo-6/) for creating weighted graph. The idea is just to **store both adjacent node and edge weight** in the dict described above. 

#### BFS and DFS for Graph

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To travel through a graph is very similar as travel through a tree. The only thing need concern is **graph has cycles!** So, we must keep a visited list that prevent as from re-visiting nodes.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To understand this problem, if we break all the cycles in a graph, we actually have a tree.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The complexity of BFS and DFS for graph is `O(E+V)` where I think `E` is for building the graph and `V` is for BFS.

#### Graph Connectivity

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's actually a simple problem to chech if there is a connectivity between two nodes, just use BFS or DFS is ok. By breaking cycles in a graph, any node can be the root of the tree.

#### Union-Find

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Union-Find is acrually a *data structure*, which is also called *disjoint set*, it has this name because it must support the action of `Find` and `Union`. So, this is not really a graph based algorithm, it's more about reasoning among a **set of point**.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a graph based problem, it's more like [this](https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-division/discuss/88175/9-lines-%22Floydu2013Warshall%22-in-Python).

##### Problem: How to `find` efficiently?

> Check [this tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/union-find-algorithm-set-2-union-by-rank/) for the most detailed explaination.

* **Union by Rank**: always attach smaller depth tree under the root of the deeper tree.
* **Path Compression**:flatten the tree when `find()` is called.

#### Minimum Spaning Tree

> Kruskal’s algorithm is like **assemble an MSP** while Prim's algorithm is **grow an MSP**.

##### Kruskal’s Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kruskal’s algorithm is simple, check [this tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/?p=26604/) for more details.

1. Sort all the edges in non-decreasing order of their weight.
2. Pick the smallest edge. Check if it forms a cycle with the spanning tree formed so far. If cycle is not formed, include this edge. Else, discard it.
3. Repeat step#2 until there are (V-1) edges in the spanning tree.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time complexity of this algorithm is `O(ElogE)` which is the complexity of ranking all the edges by its length.

##### Prim's Algorithm

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Check [this tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/prims-minimum-spanning-tree-mst-greedy-algo-5/) for the detail. Prim's algorithm focused on **find a cut** (of two sets, one contains the vertices already included in MST and other contains rest of the verices), **pick the minimum weight edge from the cut** and include this vertex to MST Set (the set that contains already included vertices).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By finding the cut, we automatically eliminated the *cycled edges* from Kruskal's algorithm.

#### Shortest Path

##### Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dijkstra’s algorithm tells you **the shortest path from one node to all the other node**.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[This link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dijkstras-shortest-path-algorithm-greedy-algo-7/) is the details for Dijkstra’s algorithm. This is very similar to Prim's algorithm for MST. Here we *grow* a SPT (shortest path tree), what being changed is just the *critieria*. In MST, we extend the node closest to any node already in the MST. Here we **extend the node currently closest to the source**.

##### Floyd Warshall Algorithm

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[This algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/floyd-warshall-algorithm-dp-16/) is for solving **all pair shortest path** problem, unlike Dijkstra's algorithm which is for **shortest path from one node to all the other nodes**.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floyd's algorithm actually has dynamic programming ideas! See [this tutorial](http://home.cse.ust.hk/faculty/golin/COMP271Sp03/Notes/MyL15.pdf) for understanding Floyd's algorithm in a DP way! 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The **state update** in Floyd's algorithm is (read the above tutorial page 6-7 for more detail):

1. Node `k` is not a vertex on the path: The shortest path between `i,j` has such length d<sub>ij</sub><sup>(k-1)</sup>.
2. is a vertex on the path: The shortest path is d<sub>ik</sub><sup>(k-1)</sup>+d<sub>kj</sub><sup>(k-1)</sup>.

### LeetCode Problems

#### 130. Surrounded Regions

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/surrounded-regions/discuss/41630/9-lines-Python-148-ms), again, **find the odd point!** Apparently the `O` on the border is the odd points in this problem, so we may directly solve the odd point first and this will make the problem way simpler.
