> **Go straight for it!** You need to clearly know what is the target and directly go for it. The target need to be carefully analyzed, in [this](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-k-closest-elements/discuss/133604/Clean-O(logN)-solution-in-Python) and [this](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/) problem, we must firstly analyze target before coding.

### To Do

1. ML interview preparing!
2. Graph LeetCode problems.
3. Divide & Conquer LeetCode.
4. Binary Search, more LeetCode.

### Python Programming
* Don't forget `set` manipulation like `| - ^ &`, check [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-set-operations-union-intersection-difference-symmetric-difference/) for more detail.
