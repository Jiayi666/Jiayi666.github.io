### Hash Table

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in [this problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/copy-list-with-random-pointer/discuss/43485/Clear-and-short-python-O(2n)-and-O(n)-solution), hash table is actually building a **one-to-one mapping** between any two space! The key can be any object, so does the values.

### Hash Set

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hash set in python is just `set(xxx)`. Unlike hash table, hash set doesn't care what is the value for each key, it just care **if an element exists in the set**.
