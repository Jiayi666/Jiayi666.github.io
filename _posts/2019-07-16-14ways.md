> [This tutorial](https://blog.csdn.net/Kaiyuan_sjtu/article/details/91313654) shows great analysis for some programming paradigms that is frequently used in code interviews.

### Python Programming

- Use `enumerate` when you need both index and element.

### Sliding Window - Reuse Previous Information

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As shown in [this problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sliding-window-maximum-maximum-of-all-subarrays-of-size-k/), the key for sliding window (or even any programming problem is to **reuse the previous information / reduce redundancy**). To successfully reuse information, we need to firstly **find good series**, then make the **useful element / information** clear, and finally build the program.

#### Find a Series

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In [this problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-subarray-minimums/discuss/170750/C++JavaPython-Stack-Solution), there are two *loops* or *series* we can spot, loop over all subarrays or loop over all elements. What makes a good series is the **connectivity** between two neighbors within the series! Here, loop over all subarrays almost gives no connectivity between two neighbors (you can get some connection if you loop over subarrays by loop over elements, but need to know it's actually come from loop over elements).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very important that sliding window algorithm must **have a state!** This is where the sliding window Alg differs from two pointer. It's normally being used *within a loop*.

#### Define Useful Elements

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As shown in both problems above, we need to define the **useful range** for us to reuse / store the previous information. Notice that defining the useful range is basically equal to defining the waste / processed range.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key for finding useful range is to **consider a normal state**. For example, consider just a random (or the first) element in the loop and find out what is the minimum information it needs.

### Two Pointer
