#### 646. Maximum Length of Pair Chain

> Just like other knowledge, it takes building blocks for analyzing. Now I'm not familiar enough for all these building blocks including dynamic programming and other algorithms. Needs more practice.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic idea about 2D dynamic programming is that the optimal solution for current state is based on **a bunch of previous optimal states!**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greedy is more like an analyzing pattern than an algorithm. The idea is that we have a clear metric to compare two state so we will directly go for the state with highest score.

#### 343. Integer Break

> There are always two ways of solving a math problem: **analytical** solution and **numerical** solution.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the star of a DP, try your best to set the **initial value** of your DP. This can be very crutial when you make futher calculation.
