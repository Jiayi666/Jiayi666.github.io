## Introspection

*	Using a question mark (?) before or after a variable will display some general information about the object.
*	Using ?? will also show the functionâ€™s source code if possible.
*	Any file can be run as a Python program inside the environment of your IPython session
using the %run command.
<pre>
		%run ipython_script_test.py
</pre>
*	Code snippets can be pasted from the clipboard in many cases by pressing `Ctrl-ShiftV`. 
*	`%paste` takes whatever text is in the clipboard and executes it as a single block
in the shell.
*	With the `%cpaste` block, you have the freedom to paste as much code as you like before
executing it.
