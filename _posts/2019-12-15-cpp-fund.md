> I need this language for interview but apparently a programming language is just a tool for development. We should focus more on how we can design a system/software with this language.

### Variables & Operator

##### New

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use of the `new` operator signifies a request for the memory allocation on the heap. If the sufficient memory is available, it initializes the memory and **returns its address** to the pointer variable.

The new operator should only be used if the data object should **remain in memory until delete is called**. Otherwise if the new operator is not used, the object is automatically destroyed when it goes out of scope.

### Class

#### Class Fundation

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**By default**, all members of a class declared with the class keyword have **private access** for all its members. Therefore, any member that is declared before any other access specifier has private access automatically.

- **private** members of a class are accessible only from within other members of *the same class* (or from their "friends").
- **protected** members are accessible from other members of the same class (or from their "friends"), but also from members of their *derived classes*.
- **public** members are accessible from anywhere where the object is visible.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A member method can be **decleared** inside the class definition and **implemented** outside with scope operator (::). For example:

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Rectangle {
    int width, height;
  public:
    void set_values (int,int);
    int area () {return width*height;}
};

void Rectangle::set_values (int x, int y) {
  width = x;
  height = y;
}
```

##### Method Overload

> In C++ to overload a method, the compiler only looks at **input parameters**. Just using different returning type will cause error.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Check [this tutorial](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/function-overloading) for more details.

##### Friend Method

> By saying "friend method", we are talking about **friend of the class**.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By using a friend method, we can **access private member of a class**! (Why not getter & setterr?) Check [this tutorial](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/friend-function-class) for more detail about friend method.

##### Constructor Initializing

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many ways to initialize an object/class.

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Circle {
    double radius;
  public:
    Circle(double r) { radius = r; }
    double circum() {return 2*radius*3.14159265;}
};

int main () {
  Circle foo (10.0);   // functional form
  Circle bar = 20.0;   // assignment init.
  Circle baz {30.0};   // uniform init.
  Circle qux = {40.0}; // POD-like

  cout << "foo's circumference: " << foo.circum() << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An advantage of uniform initialization over functional form is that, unlike parentheses, braces cannot be confused with function declarations.
