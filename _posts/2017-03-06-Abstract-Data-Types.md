### Why use a ADT?
For example, why we use a ADT named 'Bag' to contain objects in an application instead of just using list in python.

a) Focus on solving the problem at hand instead of worrying about the implementation of the container.

b) Reduce the chance of introducing errors from
misuse of the list since it provides additional operations that are not appropriate
for a bag.

c) Provide better coordination between different modules and designers.

d) Easily swap out our current implementation of the Bag ADT for a different,
possibly more efficient, version later.
