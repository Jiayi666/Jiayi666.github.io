> Except for the [official tutorial](http://wiki.ros.org/action/fullsearch/ROS/Tutorials?ÃŸaction=fullsearch&context=180&value=linkto%3A%22ROS%2FTutorials%22), I stored some useful ebook that teached ROS in different view in [my github](https://github.com/Jiayi666/ROSplay). If I didn't give a reachable link for **ebooks** for following problems, it should be about to be found in this github repository.

### Preliminary

#### Name, NameSpace \& Remapping

#### Coordinate Transform : `tf` package

### ROS Action
* ROS message is usually passed by TCP
* Service is synchronous and action is asynchronous
